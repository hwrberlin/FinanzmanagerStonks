### Goal

Evaluate the intuativity and user satisfaction of the homepage layout and features in the app.

### Method

Conduct an online survey with users who have used the app for at least one week. Ask them to rate their satisfaction with the homepage layout and the features on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly satisfied. Additionally, ask open-ended questions about what they liked and didn't like about these features.

### Results

On average, users rated their satisfaction with the homepage layout as 5 out of 5, indicating a high level of satisfaction. Users appreciated the clean and intuitive design of the homepage. The features received an average rating of 4 out of 5 Users found it useful but expressed a desire for more filtering and sorting options.

### Implications

The evaluation indicates that users are generally satisfied with the homepage layout. We will maintain the current design and focus on enhancing other areas of the app. The lower rating for the features suggests that there is room for improvement. We will consider adding more filtering and sorting options to make it easier for users to manage their transactions. We will conduct a follow-up evaluation after implementing these changes to assess their impact on user satisfaction.
