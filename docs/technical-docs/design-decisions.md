# 01: Central Placement of Core Actions

## Problem Statement
Users often struggle to find primary actions in an application, leading to frustration and extended navigation times.

## Decision
Should we place core actions centrally and visibly on the homepageor disperse them throughout the app and make many different links?

## Regarded options

### Central Placement
#### Pros
- Immediate Access: Users can quickly locate and use primary features.
- Intuitive Design: Central placement aligns with users' expectations for crucial actions.
- Efficient Navigation: Reduces the time users spend searching for features.

#### Cons
- Potentially Reduces Space: Might take up prime screen real estate.
- Overemphasis: Not all centrally placed features might be used frequently.

### Dispersed Placement
#### Pros
- Balanced Screen: Allows for a more distributed design.
- Feature Highlighting: Can highlight lesser-known features by placing them more centrally.

#### Cons
- Difficult Navigation: Users might struggle to find essential features.
- Reduced Efficiency: Might increase the time taken to execute core actions.

# 02: Buttons

## Problem statement

A lot of apps have a too many buttons to click. The user has to go through all the buttons to find the right one. This makes the experience more stressfull than it has to be.

# Decision

Do we want to have a lot of buttons or few buttons?

## Regarded options

# Many Buttons

## Pros

1. **More Features Accessible:** Having many buttons allows you to offer a greater number of features and options to the user.
2. **Direct Navigation:** Users can directly access different sections or functions of the app without going through multiple steps.
3. **Reduced Need for Menus:** You can reduce the need for complex menus or hidden features since most options are immediately visible.

## Cons

1. **Visual Clutter:** Too many buttons can create visual clutter, making the app look busy and less appealing.
2. **Overwhelming:** A large number of buttons may be overwhelming for users, especially those who are not tech-savvy.
3. **Usability Issues:** Smaller buttons or closely spaced buttons can lead to accidental taps and difficulty in targeting the desired button, especially on smaller screens.

# Few Buttons

## Pros

1. **Clean Design:** Fewer buttons result in a cleaner and more minimalist design, making the app visually appealing.
2. **Simplified User Experience:** With fewer buttons, the user experience is simplified, and users can focus on the most important tasks.
3. **Reduced Decision Fatigue:** Fewer choices mean less cognitive load for users, leading to reduced decision fatigue.

## Cons

1. **Hidden Features:** Fewer buttons often mean that certain features are hidden in menus, making them harder to discover.
2. **More Steps Required:** Users may need to go through more steps to access certain features or options.
3. **Limited Functionality:** Having fewer buttons may limit the functionality that can be readily accessed on the main screen.

# Conclusion

For our targetaudience and value proposition we desided on having only few buttons to ensure a clean design and simplified user experience.

# 03: Visible Feedback Mechanisms

## Problem Statement
Users often execute actions within an application without knowing if they were successful or what the result was. This can lead to confusion and frustration.

## Decision
Should we provide visible feedback for every significant user action or keep feedback minimal?

## Regarded options

### Visible Feedback
#### Pros
- Clear Communication: Provides immediate clarity on the outcome of an action.
- Enhanced UX: Ensures users don't have to guess or check if their action was successful.
- Reduces Errors: Can prompt the user to try again or seek help if something goes wrong.

#### Cons
- Potential for Overuse: Overdoing feedback can annoy users if not executed correctly.
- Design Challenges: Ensuring feedback is consistent and fits with the overall design.

### Minimal Feedback
#### Pros
- Cleaner UI: Less clutter in the user interface.
- Less Distraction: Allows users to focus on their tasks without frequent interruptions.

#### Cons
- Increased Uncertainty: Users may be unsure if their actions had the desired outcome.
- Potential for Errors: Without proper feedback, users might repeat actions unnecessarily.

# 04: Color Differentiation

## Problem Statement
Users often struggle to quickly distinguish between different types of transactions or data in financial applications.

## Decision
Should we use color differentiation to represent various data types, such as income and expenses?

## Regarded options

### Color Differentiation
#### Pros
- Quick Identification: Allows users to instantly recognize the type of transaction or data.
- Enhanced UX: Visual differentiation can make the app more user-friendly.
- Aesthetically Pleasing: Proper color coding can enhance the visual appeal.

### No Color Differentiation
#### Pros

- No Colorblind Issues: Won't have to worry about certain users misinterpreting colors.

#### Cons
- Slower Data Processing: Users might take longer to differentiate between data types.
- Potential Confusion: Without colors, data might blend together.
