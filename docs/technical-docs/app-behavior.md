# [App behavior]
Our app starts with the login and signup. With this you can create a new account or connect to your existing account. After that, you land on the homepage from where you can access everywhere. On the homepage you will see the account balance, the 5 last transactions, an overview graph and a budget.  You can also go to the Transaction overview, where you can see all the transactions, and you can easily delete transactions in the overview by pressing a button. You can also go to the Statistics panel on the homepage, where you can see a more detailed overview. Next you can go to the budget panel from the homepage to create a budget. You can also edit your profile by clicking on the edit profile button, where you can change your username or delete your account. Lastly, as an admin user, you can also see the control button, which allows you to delete other users. Everything here is kept very simple and as clear as possible.
